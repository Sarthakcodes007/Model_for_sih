# Yellow Rust Segmentation Web Application

üåæ **AI-powered crop disease detection and analysis through an intuitive web interface**

## Overview

This Streamlit web application provides an easy-to-use interface for detecting yellow rust disease in wheat crop images using our trained deep learning model (U-Net with ResNet34 encoder).

## Features

- üéØ **Precise Detection**: Pixel-level segmentation of yellow rust areas
- üìä **Quantitative Analysis**: Rust percentage, confidence scores, and detailed metrics
- üé® **Multiple Visualizations**: Binary masks, probability heatmaps, and overlay visualizations
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Adjustable Parameters**: Confidence threshold and detection enhancement options
- üíæ **Downloadable Results**: Save segmentation masks and visualizations
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Trained Model**: Ensure you have completed model training and have checkpoint files:
   - `models/checkpoints/best.pth` (trained model weights)
   - `configs/config.yaml` (model configuration)

2. **Dependencies**: Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Using the startup script (Recommended)
```bash
python run_app.py
```

#### Option 2: Direct Streamlit command
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Accessing the Application

1. The application will automatically open in your default web browser
2. If it doesn't open automatically, navigate to: `http://localhost:8501`
3. The application runs on your local machine - no internet connection required for inference

## How to Use

### Step 1: Upload Image
- Click on "Choose an image file" in the upload section
- Select a crop image (supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF)
- The application will display file details and a preview

### Step 2: Configure Settings (Optional)
- **Confidence Threshold**: Adjust the sensitivity of rust detection (0.1 - 0.9)
  - Higher values = more conservative detection
  - Lower values = more sensitive detection
- **Enhanced Detection**: Enable additional image processing for better results

### Step 3: Analyze Image
- Click the "üöÄ Analyze Image" button
- Wait for the AI model to process the image (usually takes a few seconds)
- View the comprehensive results

### Step 4: Review Results

The application provides multiple views of the analysis:

#### Visual Results
- **Original Image**: Your uploaded image
- **Segmentation Result**: Overlay showing detected rust areas in red
- **Binary Mask**: Black and white mask showing rust locations
- **Probability Heatmap**: Color-coded probability map (red = high probability)

#### Quantitative Metrics
- **Rust Coverage**: Percentage of image area affected by rust
- **Confidence Score**: Model's confidence in the prediction
- **Pixel Counts**: Total pixels and rust-affected pixels

### Step 5: Download Results (Optional)
- **Download Visualization**: Save the overlay image with detected rust areas
- **Download Mask**: Save the binary segmentation mask

## Understanding the Results

### Rust Coverage Interpretation
- **0-5%**: Low rust infection - monitor regularly
- **5-15%**: Moderate infection - consider treatment
- **15%+**: High infection - immediate action recommended

### Confidence Score
- **0.8-1.0**: High confidence - reliable results
- **0.6-0.8**: Good confidence - generally reliable
- **Below 0.6**: Lower confidence - manual verification recommended

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: U-Net with ResNet34 encoder
- **Training Dataset**: YELLOW-RUST-19
- **Performance**: 94.21% validation IoU
- **Input Size**: 256x256 pixels
- **Classes**: Background (0) and Rust (1)

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Image Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, and optionally enhance
2. **AI Inference**: Deep learning model prediction
3. **Post-processing**: Threshold application and mask generation
4. **Visualization**: Create overlays and probability maps
5. **Metrics Calculation**: Compute rust percentage and confidence

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Model file not found" Error
- Ensure you have trained the model and checkpoint files exist
- Check paths: `models/checkpoints/best.pth` and `configs/config.yaml`
- Run the training script if you haven't done so

#### "Error loading image" Message
- Check if the image file is corrupted
- Ensure the image format is supported
- Try with a different image

#### Slow Processing
- Large images take longer to process
- Consider using GPU if available (automatic detection)
- Close other applications to free up system resources

#### Application Won't Start
- Check if all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure Streamlit is installed: `pip install streamlit`
- Try running with: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

### Performance Tips

1. **Image Size**: Smaller images (< 2MB) process faster
2. **GPU Usage**: The application automatically uses GPU if available
3. **Batch Processing**: For multiple images, consider using the command-line inference script
4. **Browser**: Use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for best performance
