# 🌱 Crop Disease Classification using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** that can classify **39 crops** into their respective disease categories.  
It’s designed to help farmers and researchers quickly identify plant health conditions from images.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Classifies **39 crop varieties** into healthy/disease categories  
- ✅ Simple **test script (`test.py`)** for predictions  
- ✅ Easy to modify image input path directly in the script  
- ✅ Built with deep learning (PyTorch/Keras/TensorFlow – whichever you used)
